  <a href="https://adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a> is an annual set of programming puzzles, released over the course of the first 25 days of December. Each day has 2 parts to the puzzle; the second part being revealed after successfully completing the first part.

  <h3>Why not a repository?</h3>

  For previous years, I've organized into a repository my solutions, my input values, and the day's prompt stored as markdown. I don't expect anyone to actually clone my AoC solutions to Ⓐ run or Ⓑ submit pull requests or other suggestions via GitHub or similar Git forge platforms. Given this, I've decided to simply provide my solutions in-line with the prompts. Because the original prompts are given as HTML, I'm storing (and re-publishing) as HTML to avoid lossiness.
