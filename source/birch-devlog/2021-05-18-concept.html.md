Time and time again over the past few years, I’ve wanted to build a program, a file format specification, or service that fills a particular niche for me. The existing tools that I’ve wanted to replace with this are AirTable, Notion, Jupyter, small scripts, and even WolframAlpha.

That is, I want a tool that can serve as a linked notes application, a structured database of user values, a wide set of predefined databases, and the ability to insert scripts inline. It’s a big idea, I know. I imagine it will take many years to build, perhaps many iterations to get right.

Given that it’s such a large project, I want to record my progress here. Not only will this devlog will serve as a record of self reflection and a sounding board for ideas, but it will also be a place for those interested to keep updated on the progress.

For now, I’ll be giving the project the name "Birch".
