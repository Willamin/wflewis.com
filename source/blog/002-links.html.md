I've been meaning to begin publishing links that I find interesting. You can think of this as a [link log](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linklog), retweeting, or a newsletter. These will be links that I've found on various link aggregator platforms, social media, or chatrooms that I frequent. I'll only post the links that I find particularly interesting, so you can expect that my link log will be relatively curated.

Without further ado: <ins><a href="/linklog/">/linklog/</a> and <a href="//wflewis.com/linklog/feed.xml"> the feed itself</a></ins> <del>[links.wfl.space](https://links.wfl.space) and [the feed itself](http://links.wfl.space/feed.xml)</del>.
