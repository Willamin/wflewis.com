[{"content": "It is really difficult for the average person to fully conceive of how useless NFTs are. We're primed for reason. If people are making so much noise about this technology-- if it IS technology, at all-- then surely it does SOMETHING... right?","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480312592803446790#m","date":"Jan 9, 2022 · 10:56 PM UTC"},{"content":"(The answer is, no. It does absolutely nothing.)","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480312873876393986#m","date":"Jan 9, 2022 · 10:57 PM UTC"},{"content":"It records a crytocurrency transaction and appends arbitrary data to the transaction. That's it.\n\nThe general agreement is that this transaction confers ownership of whatever data is appended to the record, but there is no mechanism for enforcing that ownership...","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480313069591007233#m","date":"Jan 9, 2022 · 10:58 PM UTC"},{"content":"...and often the data is abstract or imaginary. You &#34;own&#34; a gun in a video game, but that gun may or may not actually exist. There may or may not be a way to equip, shoot, or even look at it.","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480313376836395008#m","date":"Jan 9, 2022 · 10:59 PM UTC"},{"content":"None of those functions are inherent to the NFT. They all rely on external infrastructure, which exists independent of the NFT. If you're wondering what role the NFT *does* play, then, the answer is nothing-- it parted a fool from his Monopoly money. That's it.","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480313569430458369#m","date":"Jan 9, 2022 · 11:00 PM UTC"},{"content":"You &#34;own&#34; a monkey jpeg, except you don't. The data appended to the NFT is just a link pointing to the monkey. You don't necessarily or intrinsically control the server space hosting the jpeg. You may have absolutely no way to influence the jpeg.","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480313851824508931#m","date":"Jan 9, 2022 · 11:01 PM UTC"},{"content":"So, if you can't delete the jpeg, alter the jpeg, move the jpeg, hide the location of the jpeg from public scrutiny, or stop other people from downloading, copying, modifying, and redistributing the jpeg, in what sense do you own it?","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480314179848396809#m","date":"Jan 9, 2022 · 11:02 PM UTC"},{"content":"Well... you don't. You &#34;own&#34; a ledger entry saying that you paid someone smarter than you X amount of cryptocurrency, and also, there is a picture of a monkey located at X url.\n\n(Which may or may not be true, as while the ledger entry is immutable, the data it points to is not.)","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480314637316993025#m","date":"Jan 9, 2022 · 11:04 PM UTC"},{"content":"The idea that this is &#34;your&#34; monkey jpeg pretty much just relies on social consensus, since you have no tools to enforce ownership.","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480314893081493504#m","date":"Jan 9, 2022 · 11:05 PM UTC"},{"content":"Likewise, if you buy a special gun in Ghost Recon: Wildlands, well, sure, it's 'your' gun, and you can do anything you want with it. As long as what you want to do is something the person who made the gun lets you do, because ultimately they control the data, not you.","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480315272544325636#m","date":"Jan 9, 2022 · 11:07 PM UTC"},{"content":"If what you want to do is redeem some kind of code associated with the NFT's data, you might be in luck. If you want to do anything else-- say, bring your gun into Fortnite-- you will discover that Fortnite has not obliged you by building an &#34;import gun&#34; button for you to push.","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480315707166441474#m","date":"Jan 9, 2022 · 11:09 PM UTC"},{"content":"So, if your Ghost Recon: Wildlands gun is basically just a DLC gun for Ghost Recon: Wildlands, what was the point of making it an NFT in the first place?\n\nAnswer: there was no point. This served no purpose at all. We already have DLC infrastructure that works way better.","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480315988885311488#m","date":"Jan 9, 2022 · 11:10 PM UTC"},{"content":"It is useless technology. It's weird for a technology to be useless, but it literally does almost nothing, and the one thing it does (scribe a transaction on an immutable ledger) isn't very useful for any of the use-cases people like to speculate about.","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480316287704252422#m","date":"Jan 9, 2022 · 11:11 PM UTC"},{"content":"Basically, the thing to focus on about nonfungible tokens is the word &#34;token.&#34; The token is the data. It's what distinguishes an NFT from a regular crypto ledger transaction.\n\nIt's a token: a useless object which may be traded in for a useful object, theoretically.","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480334853279207431#m","date":"Jan 10, 2022 · 12:25 AM UTC"},{"content":"What happens to all your minigolf arcade tokens when the minigolf place shuts down?\n\nWell, you're left with a bunch of useless tokens.","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480334961504886794#m","date":"Jan 10, 2022 · 12:25 AM UTC"},{"content":"In the case of nearly all NFTs, these tokens exist without a corresponding trade-in counter. It's not just defunct: there was never anyone willing to do anything in response to being presented with the token in the first place.","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480335402720538627#m","date":"Jan 10, 2022 · 12:27 AM UTC"},{"content":"Most NFTs right now are being traded against lofty promises that, some day, there will be a miraculous prize counter where these tokens may be redeemed for all sorts of wondrous splendors.\n\nThis prize counter is never going to exist. In many cases, it CANNOT exist.","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480335820250927109#m","date":"Jan 10, 2022 · 12:28 AM UTC"},{"content":"In the few cases where the promises being made aren't flatly impossible because of technological, logistical, or legal barriers, the thing the token would enable generally already exists in a much more convenient form.","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480336405352095751#m","date":"Jan 10, 2022 · 12:31 AM UTC"},{"content":"&#34;An NFT could bind together words, images, video, and music into a new form of literature!&#34;\n\nThat's a website. Homestuck. You're describing Homestuck.\n\nWhat, exactly, are you supposed to do with a token valued at one (1) Homestuck?","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480336868633894918#m","date":"Jan 10, 2022 · 12:33 AM UTC"},{"content":"Who is going to give you one (1) Homestuck? You could sell your token to someone else, but what are THEY going to do with it?

If they represent a gun in a video game, that video game has to put in the infrastructure to process the token.","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480338157317103617#m","date":"Jan 10, 2022 · 12:38 AM UTC"},{"content":"If they represent an issue of a comic book, the comic book publisher has to set up infrastructure to process the token and give its owner access to the comic.","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480338409193410560#m","date":"Jan 10, 2022 · 12:39 AM UTC"},{"content":"You might have noticed that you can already buy DLC in video games, or comics online, without using NFTs. You would be correct. What difference does an NFT bring to the table?","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480338791097413637#m","date":"Jan 10, 2022 · 12:40 AM UTC"},{"content":"Well, there's just one thing, assuming the infrastructure is set up around it and it works: the token is digitally unique. It can be tracked as it is traded across the blockchain.\n\nSo it reintroduces one of the major flaws that digital distribution conquered: scarcity.","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480339100095893505#m","date":"Jan 10, 2022 · 12:41 AM UTC"},{"content":"Why would you want digital scarcity? The answer is, you wouldn't, not unless you were some kind of market speculator.","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480339229511229441#m","date":"Jan 10, 2022 · 12:42 AM UTC"},{"content":"Let's return to comics for a moment. Okay, let's say Marvel has set up infrastructure for processing Spider-Man tokens into Spider-Man comics.","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480339430493888515#m","date":"Jan 10, 2022 · 12:43 AM UTC"},{"content":"This is where you run into the final poison pill of the whole scheme:\n\nYour token serial number may be unique, but your Spider-Man comic is not.","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480339542431440896#m","date":"Jan 10, 2022 · 12:43 AM UTC"},{"content":"It's the same Amazing Spider-Man issue #593 that everyone is reading in comic shops.

Once they shut down or overhaul their web backend and break the URL the token points to at some point in the future... well. The minigolf arcade closed.","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480340441635725312#m","date":"Jan 10, 2022 · 12:47 AM UTC"},{"content":"Collectors will still want paper comics, because physical scarcity isn't artificial.","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480340592693551105#m","date":"Jan 10, 2022 · 12:47 AM UTC"},{"content":"Comics are also particularly illustrative because they underwent a speculative investor rush in the 1990s, when everyone suddenly wanted to rush in and snap up whatever was going to be &#34;the next Action Comics #1&#34;","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480340874429181952#m","date":"Jan 10, 2022 · 12:49 AM UTC"},{"content":"The industry was happy to oblige them, running off limited collector's special edition versions of every creatively, artistically, and economically worthless random issue of every book on the shelf.","href":"/HoldenShearer/status/1480341043354734599#m","date":"Jan 10, 2022 · 12:49 AM UTC"},{"content":"Everyone in the world bought a copy of Spawn #1, waiting eagerly for it to become worth thousands of dollars.
